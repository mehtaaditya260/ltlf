Long Term Load Forecasting
==========================

Load forecasting is a technique used by power companies to predict the power or energy needed to balance the supply and load demand at all the times. It is mandatory for proper functioning of electrical industry.

**Designed and developed for the Alberta Electric System Operator**

This application is designed to help the load forecasting group to forecast Alberta electricity demand over the next 10-25 years.
It loads historical electrical demand, analyzes growth patterns, allows for adjustment of forecasting variables, and presents simulated forecasts in tabular and interactive graphical form.

We had a small, tight dev team, good leadership and a great set of customers. It was a lot of fun.
