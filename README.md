Long Term Load Forecasting
==========================

**Designed and developed for the Alberta Electric System Operator**

This application is designed to help the load forecasting group to forecast Alberta electricity demand over the next 10-25 years.
It loads historical electrical demand, analyzes growth patterns, allows for adjustment of forecasting variables, and presents simulated forecasts in tabular and interactive graphical form.

We had a small, tight dev team, good leadership and a great set of customers. It was a lot of fun.
